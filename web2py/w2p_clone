web2py_clone becomes part of the web2py distribution available
on Pypi via 'pip install web2py'

web2py_clone is one of multiple commands that become available after running
'pip install web2py' in a virtual environment. It requires
mercurial to be installed in the virtual environment.

web2py_clone creates a local clone from the Web2py google code
project in the directory "./web2py," a directory called web2py
one directory up from the location of this script.

./bin/web2py_clone
