Eve Metrics websites kit.

These are web pages used by the Eve analytics team to display information from EVE Online.
Note that his project does not contain any Eve data, or can connect to any Eve data source.

The Eve Metrics websites kit is a stand-alone product, but requires a lot of knowledege about its inner working to get up and running. The kit depends on a SQL Server with carefully crafted tables and data in order to work. 

IF YOU PLAN ON USING THIS, DO SO AT YOUR OWN RISK.
